# R mip package

## Purpose and Functionality

The mip package provides a visualization tools for model intercomparison results stored in quitte class format.


## Installation

For installation of the most recent package version an additional repository has to be added in R:

```r
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", rd3mod_repo = "http://www.pik-potsdam.de/rd3mod/R/"))
```
The additional repository can be made availably permanently by adding the line above to a file called `.Rprofile` stored in the home folder of your system (`Sys.glob("~")` in R returns the home directory).

After that the most recent version of the package can be installed using `install.packages`:

```r 
install.packages("mip")
```

Package updates can be installed using `update.packages` (make sure that the additional repository has been added before running that command):

```r 
update.packages()
```
